Our main aim is to develop an Explainable AI (XAI) based
model for heavy rainfall events. In this project a web application is developed
based on XAI using satellite data. Further, it also explains an explainable module
into the AI model (XAI). Machine Learning techniques can be used in this case,
but still, it is emerging and challenging in providing accurate predictions. XAI
helps in accurate model prediction and AI powered decision making. LIME
(Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) based Explainable AI model
is used for accurate predictions and regressor by approximating it locally with an
interpretable model.
The main aim of the project is to develop an Explainable AI (XAI) based model for 
prediction of heavy impact rainfall events using the satellite data.
